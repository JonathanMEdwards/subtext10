## Here lies Subtext 10

This work is from 2020, starting from the language spec of Subtext 9
which was done in 2019. The highlight might be a new approach to the [Update
Problem](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1465).

Here is the highly incomplete [documentation](doc/language.md). The most
theoretically interesting bit is [Feedback](doc/language.md#feedback). I don't advise
trying to read or run the code.
