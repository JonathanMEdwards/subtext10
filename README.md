## Here lies Subtext 10

This repo is the result of two years work from Fall 2018 to Fall 2020. After
much prior work on interactive non-textual programming experiences, I turned to
designing the syntax and semantics of a textual language. The result is insanely
divergent, with far too many new ideas for anyone to ever understand all at
once. The highlight might be a new approach to the [Update
Problem](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1465). I started writing a paper but
had to conclude that these results are essentially incommunicable. No one is
willing to invest the effort in understanding such wildly alien stuff unless
they first see clear proof of its benefits, which would require a massive
further investment in R&D. There is no viable path forward from here. I hope to
revive some of these ideas in future work.

Here is the highly incomplete [documentation](doc/language.md). I don't advise
trying to read or run the code.
